<h2><strong>Bad Design&nbsp;Habits</strong></h2>
<p>One of the habit I have when I was still learning design is by looking at great designers designs or look to similar industries and see how the color would look into my current project and I didn&rsquo;t spend some thoughts to articulate why I chose it though I have a gut feeling that it would suit the project. Most of the time using your instinct would work when choosing a color but wouldn&rsquo;t be nice if you put some thoughts about why you picked a set of color that would work best to your audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i thought it would be nice to share my process how I make one as I continually learn about colors and the psychology of it, there are many ways to create color pallete but here is my take&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2><strong>How to make a color&nbsp;palette?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Know your&nbsp;audience</strong></h3>
<p>Who is the primary, secondary and tertiary audience? Do the projects focussed on men, women or both?</p>
<p>Once you have an idea about your audience, creating a persona that has details of their personality and demographics could help you to make a decision on the colors that would suit them. Always consider the association they might remember based on the context of the product.</p>
<p>For example, using red would work well for a dating site but it would feel different in a health app as it might them remind of blood or violence. If your audience is extroverts and people that love to have fun then dull and desaturated color might not appeal to them. Again design is subjective, you need to test to figure this out.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand the client&nbsp;goal</strong></h3>
<p>Where will they often go to use the design that you are making? Will it be offline or online? What is the client&rsquo;s budget if there will be more print? If they are on <a href="https://www.insights4print.ceo/2017/01/brand-colors-printing-cmyk-better-safe-sorry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.insights4print.ceo/2017/01/brand-colors-printing-cmyk-better-safe-sorry/">tight budget,</a>using more black and white and few color accents would help them.</p>
<p>What is message that the project is trying to communicate? What emotion do they want their users to feel when using the product?</p>
<p>If the client would give you the freedom to explore, studying creative briefs from the client could reveal some keywords that would is useful the look and feel of the design. Another method does brand attribution workshop</p>
<h3><strong>Mood Boarding Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>So you understand the goal of your client and audience and let&rsquo;s say you have decided to with fresh and organic feel for a health app or give users a calm and focus feeling for a mindfulness app. It is time for you to curate some visual elements, this is where your keywords would be handy.</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<h3><strong>Try to make it relatable</strong></h3>
<p>Use graphics that the client could relate to. For health app, use photos of healthy people, healthy foods etc to create a healthy food, for fashion use visuals that are related to people that would ear it. You could also use metaphor object such as a plant for fresh or fire for arousal.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Less is more</strong></h4>
<p>Create only 2&ndash;3 variants to avoid confusing client when deciding what direction to go. Use 3&ndash;5 visual elements for each board to not overwhelm the client when looking at it, remember they are busy to overthink about your visual. Always pick elements that would create the mood you want to convey.</p>
<h4><strong>Use Pinterest or google image for elements</strong></h4>
<p>Use google image or Pinterest to find visuals. I love Pinterest because it is easier to find visual that has visual harmony</p>
<p>If necessary make the images cohesive using the color adjustment tool</p>
<h4><strong>Define the dominant, subdominant and accent</strong></h4>
<p>Accent has a strong contrast which is perfect for buttons or simply to grab attention but must carefully use to not make a user feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dontcodetired.com/blog/post/Colour-Thinking-in-Proportions-%28Dominant-Subdominant-and-Accent%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="http://dontcodetired.com/blog/post/Colour-Thinking-in-Proportions-(Dominant-Subdominant-and-Accent)">dominant</a>color, it is either dark or white value and is the most visible color</p>
<p>Subdominant are colors that would compliment the dominant color and I usually use it for secondary background.</p>
<h3><strong>Mood Board Examples</strong></h3>
<p>Below are simple mood board I created</p>

<h2><strong>Presenting to&nbsp;Client</strong></h2>
<p>When presenting the mood board to a client, be sure to articulate why this color is appropriate for the brand. What is the pros and cons of other mood from the other one.</p>
<p>All design is subjective <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/media/2412539/articulating-design-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.overdrive.com/media/2412539/articulating-design-decisions">(Tom Greever, 2015)</a>, without articulating the idea behind the decision then more like they would choose color based on personal preference and not something that would actually appropriate for the product.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Color like typography and other elements of design has a big impact on design. As a designer, we should be aware of how the users would feel once they interact with your design. It more helpful to a color that is appropriate to the context of the product. Design is not art, we are problem solvers.</p>
